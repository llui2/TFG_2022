# Learning Network Structures In Discrete Statistical Models

This is the updated version of the code used in my final degree project about the inverse problem of the Viana-Bray spin-glass model with a discrete distribution of the couplings.

## About

In order to run the simulations, one should set the parameters in the `input.txt` file and then execute `execute.sh` to obtain the results.

The simulation will generate the equilibrium samples `S_p_SEED.bin`, the files containing the accuracy of the reconstructions `g_p.dat` and its structure in `J_p_SEED.dat`.

The original version of the code when the project was delivered can be found in the OV directory.
